This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect or missing key prop for items in the data array.  The key prop is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render items, and a missing or duplicate key can lead to unexpected behavior like incorrect item rendering, extra items appearing, or items not updating correctly.
